    Add semester key to the completedEvaluation Object


Semester
    On semester creation, all preferences need to be set for each tutor based off their major cluster, lead teams need to be created, then all l2t and t2l assignments will be made

If Charles can't put role into the service, does Account need to be keyed on semester?
TeamMembers should be keyed by semester
