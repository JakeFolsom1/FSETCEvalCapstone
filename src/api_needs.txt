Reduce clutter for assignmentProgress by making a function that returns a list of people who need to do evals in the following format
    [name, lead (true if lead), [asurites they need to evaluate]]

Function to get the leads of the current semester
    or
Function that will return all lead teams in the following format
    [{leadAsurite: [...teamMembersAsurites]}]

Should we let them set the number of peer evaluations that they want to assign?
    If so that needs to have additional UI
    and persist on the DB

Need to add the evaluation number to assignments 1 through N (that they set)
